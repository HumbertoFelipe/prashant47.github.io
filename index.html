			As a part of this project we demonstrated working of our proposed framework by
			porting an interpreter named PicoC, C library named dietlibc and small in house linkage
			editor to Xv6 operating system. This report will elaborate on strategies to be used while
			porting system softwares to new kernel as well as on comprehensive measures that can
			be used in undergraduate as well as graduate courses of operating systems and system
			programming for better understanding of their basic functionality in pedagogy purposes.
